 TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------

If you are using Linux and this library does not appear to be working, ensure that you have the correct permissions set to access the serial port on your system.  One way to test this is to run your application as root or by using the 'sudo' command.  If everything works, you will need to either run your application as root in the future or fix the permissions on your system.  For further instructions, refer to the Troubleshooting Wiki at https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/wiki/Troubleshooting.

An additional note for Linux users:  If you are operating this library in event-based mode, the LISTENING_EVENT_DATA_WRITTEN event will never occur.  This is not a bug, but rather a limitation of the Linux operating system.

For other troubleshooting issues, please see if you can find an answer in either the Usage Wiki at https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/wiki/Usage-Examples or the Troubleshooting Wiki at https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/wiki/Troubleshooting.

If your question is still not answered, feel free to open an issue report on this project's GitHub page (https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/issues), and we will be glad to look into it.
